Dear Sir/Madam\\

I studied computer science, specializing in applied mathematics. I am writing
you to apply for my biggest passion in life, which is software development and
to continue evolving further in the realm of research and development.

I'm currently employed at Ericsson in Kista as a Software Developer and Team
Leader. I develop drivers for the radio units in the Radio Base Station 6000
series. My career started at SAAB Combitech as a consultant for Ericsson, where
I developed a test framework in Perl which is used to run automated test cases.
The test cases was written in Tcl/Expect but the framework can also execute
test cases in Perl or bash and support NetConf. The test framework became a
separate product and is now used to test different Linux embedded operating
systems by all Ericsson products at the department. I continued at the same
department but as a designer where I developed Linux kernel patches and pushed
them upstreams to Linus Torvalds.

During my research at the University of Toronto, I became extremely interested
in operations research, optimization and solving NP-hard combinatorial problems
with the help of distributed algorithms. The result of my experience working
abroad together with a PhD student ended in a published paper. The whole
experience abroad gave me new friends for life, deepened my analytical thinking
and broaden my knowledge in research and software development.

As one of the former committee member in LUDD, the computer society in the
university, I'm good at organizing meetings and social activities. Serving for
the Swedish marine strengthen my ability to work in a team, become more
structural with a high degree of responsibility in a stressful environment.

My friends and co workers think of me as an outgoing, yet calm, kindhearted and
responsible person with great will power.

For your convenience, I have attached this letter and my CV. Thank you for your
consideration. I look forward to hearing from you.
\closing{Yours Sincerely,}
