Dear Sir/Madam\

I studied computer science, specializing in applied mathematics. I am writing
you to apply for my biggest passion in life, which is software development and
to continue evolving further in the realm of research and development.

I'm currently employed at Ericsson in Kista as a Software Developer and Team
Leader. I develop drivers for the radio hardware units used in the Radio Base
Station 6000 series. In order to first boot and bring up the radio hardware, the
different drivers for the many components on the board needs to be working and
configured correctly. This is done by either creating the drivers from scratch
using the components datasheet and the boards circuit diagram or simply by
adapting and reusing existing drivers. In most cases we emulate the hardware
first and write the drivers before the physical boards arrive from the factory
to save time and money.

My career started at SAAB Combitech as a consultant for Ericsson, where I
developed a test framework in Perl which is used to run automated test cases.
The test cases was written in Tcl/Expect but the framework can also execute
test cases in Perl or bash and also support NetConf. The test framework became a
separate product and is now used to test different Linux embedded operating
systems by all Ericsson products at the department. I continued in the same
department but as a designer where I began to develop Linux kernel patches and
pushed upstreams to Linus Torvalds.

During my research at the University of Toronto, I became extremely interested
in operations research, optimization and solving NP-hard combinatorial problems
with the help of distributed algorithms. The result of my experience working
abroad together with a PhD student ended in a published paper. The whole
experience abroad gave me new friends for life, deepened my analytical thinking
and broaden my knowledge in research and software development.

As one of the former committee member in LUDD, the computer society in the
university, I'm good at organizing meetings and social activities. Serving for
the Swedish marine strengthen my ability to work in a team, become more
structural with a high degree of responsibility in a stressful environment.

My friends and co workers think of me as an outgoing, yet calm, kindhearted and
responsible person with great will power.

For your convenience, I have attached this letter and my CV. Thank you for your
consideration. I look forward to hearing from you.
\closing{Yours Sincerely,}
