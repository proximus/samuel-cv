Dear Sir/Madam\

I am writing to express my interest in the \textbf{System Integrator} position at your company. With over 15 years of experience in Linux and embedded systems development, system integration, and IT automation, I bring a strong technical foundation combined with a positive, solution-oriented mindset. I take pride in being not only a skilled engineer but also a kind, social, and collaborative team member who enjoys creating a good atmosphere while solving challenging problems.

As the owner of Saitama AB, I have worked as a consultant for leading technology companies such as Ericsson and CrossControl, where I combined hands-on software development with system integration and leadership responsibilities. My recent work at Ericsson Radio Software team involved balancing roles as Product Owner, Scrum Master, and Developer - overseeing backlog creation and refinement, improving workflows, and implementing drivers and test cases for advanced radio systems. These experiences strengthened both my technical versatility and my ability to lead teams with empathy, clear communication, and enthusiasm.

I have extensive experience in Linux and Windows platforms, system deployment, automation, and security hardening. My projects have involved configuring and integrating networked systems, implementing zero-touch automation using Ansible, and working with technologies such as Yocto, Kubernetes, Git, Jenkins, Active Directory, and PowerShell. I am fluent in C/C++, Python, and Bash, and have developed and debugged embedded firmware, kernel drivers, and high-performance applications for both Linux and RTOS environments.

Throughout my career, I have been deeply involved in system analysis, integration, verification, and deployment, with a particular focus on security-critical systems. I am a natural problem solver who approaches challenges with curiosity, persistence, and a positive attitude. I enjoy working closely with customers and colleagues, sharing knowledge, and building trust through reliability and openness. My fluency in English and Swedish allows me to communicate effectively in diverse and international teams.

I am motivated by solving complex technical challenges and continuously improving systems and workflows. I believe that my combination of technical expertise, friendly and collaborative nature, and dedication to quality make me a strong fit for this position.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the opportunity to discuss how I can contribute to your team.
\closing{Kind regards,}

\end{letter}
