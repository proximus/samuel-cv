\section{Experience}
\cventry{2018 -- Ongoing}{Chief Executive Officer (CEO)}{Saitama AB}{Stockholm}{Sweden}{
Owner and founder of the consultant company Saitama AB.
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{\textit{Consultant at Ericsson AB - Systems and Technology (R\&D)}}\newline{}
Platform development of 5G and 6G test beds to field trial prototypes. The
platform team is responsible for the application to run on a real-time system
and to minimize CPU jitter and NIC latency that the baseband application is
running on. Hence, we deliver a library based on DPDK and misc tools for upper
layer applications.
    \begin{itemize}
    \item Write UDP server and enable hardware timestamping on NIC to measure
          packet Round Trip Time (RTT).
    \item Write AF\_XDP high performance packet processing client with zero-copy
          to run on Mellanox CX-6 and Intel XL710 that support XDP.
    \item Implement zero-touch automation on Ericsson proprietary hardware and
          commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) hardware like SuperMicro and Dell
          PowerEdge machines that has BMC/IPMI/iDRAC. The automation conducts
          a full deployment on multiple nodes in parallel and configures BIOS,
          LDAP, autoinstalls unattended Linux OS and sets up real-time OS
          properties with low CPU jitter and low NIC latency.
    \end{itemize}

\cventry{2016--2018}{Senior Software Architect and Design}{Realtime Embedded AB}{Stockholm}{Sweden}{
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{\textit{Consultant at NorthStar}}\newline{}
Development of NorthStar Advanced Connected Energy (ACE) gateway smart battery
system.
    \begin{itemize}
    \item Implement external alarm handling for the battery system. Ensure that
          the software can trigger and control relays through the GPIO pins in
          the gateway when correct signaling through IPC messages are received.
    \item Implement functional tests and libraries/packages using the 9pm test
          framework.
    \end{itemize}
\item \textbf{\textit{Consultant at Vanderbilt (former Bewator)}}\newline{}
Development of Linux Kernel drivers for access control system called
Omnis. The hardware used was called E100 which is developed on site
and is similar to AT91SAM9x5-EK.
    \begin{itemize}
    \item Write GPIO test application to control relays.
    \item Write Atmel AT91 ADC test application to read voltage raw values.
    \item Write Linux kernel and device tree patch to enable USB-B gadget and
          Ethernet over USB.
    \item Write Linux kernel driver and application for 74VHC595 8-bit shift
          register with output latches in order to control via sysfs LEDs, input
          ports and RS485 card readers.
    \item Write Linux kernel driver and test application for Magstripe
          (Clock/Data) and Wiegand (Data/Data) card readers.
    \item Write a firmware upgrade/flash script to automatically update the
          system using the SD/MMC card during bootup.
    \item Modify and patch the bootloader from Atmel called at91bootstrap in
          order to fix bugs and enable bootup of SD/MMC or NAND flash.
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\cventry{2011--2016}{Team Leader/Software Developer}{Ericsson AB}{Stockholm}{Sweden}{
Employed at Ericsson in Kista as a Software Developer and Team Leader. I
developed drivers for the radio hardware units used in the Radio Base Station
6000 series. In order to first boot and bring up the radio hardware, the
different drivers for the many components on the board needs to be working and
configured correctly. This is done by either creating the drivers from scratch
using the components data sheet and the boards circuit diagram or simply by
adapting and reusing existing drivers. In most cases we emulate the hardware
first and then write the drivers, before the physical boards arrive from the
factory, to save time and money.
    \begin{itemize}
    \item Development of radio software drivers for the Radio SW platforms and
          Radio Hardware emulation. Board bringup and integration of hardware
          products like Antenna Integrated Radio unit (AIR), Micro Radios,
          Next Generation Radios and the 5G Program. Other side tasks include
          splitting parts of the Radio SW code into modules, introducing Git,
          Gerrit, Jenkins, BitBake and Autotools.
    \item Short term assignment (3 months) at the hardware department in Ottawa
          as a software integrator for Platform 5.2 AIR 32 products.
    \item Act as a technical Scrum/Kanban Master to lead and coach a
          Cross-Functional Driver team of 10 people. Conduct daily scrum
          meetings, sprint retrospective meetings, keep statistics of flow,i
          eliminate waste and help Product Owner.
    \end{itemize}

\cventry{2008--2011}{Software Developer}{SAAB Combitech}{Stockholm}{Sweden}{
My first consultant job started at SAAB Combitech for Ericsson AB Linux Center
in Älvsjö and Telefonplan. There, I developed a test framework in Perl which is
used to run automated test cases. The test cases was written in Tcl/Expect but
the framework can also execute test cases in Perl or Bash and also support
NetConf. The test framework became a separate product and was used to test
different Linux embedded operating systems by many Ericsson products at the
department. I continued in the same department but as a designer where I began
to develop Linux kernel patches and pushed upstream to Linus Torvalds.
    \begin{itemize}
    \item Develop drivers and Linux kernel patches for the Ericsson Linux
          distribution called ENUX, which is used to run a Virtual Machine to
          emulate APZ classic run time environment for PLEX based programs such
          as AXE.
    \item Designer and tester for other Ericsson platform products such as CPBS,
          GSDI and IS running on GEP board hardware.
    \item Framework developer for automated test cases.
    \item Develop automated test cases for Ericsson products Linux Open-source
          Telecom Cluster (LOTC) and SLES Virtual Platform (SVP) based on Xen.
    \item Open Multimedia Platform (OMP) customer forum support.
    \item Handle and solve trouble reports for all the products.
    \end{itemize}
}
\bigskip

\cventry{2006--2007}{Research Assistant}{University of Toronto}{Toronto}{Canada}{
I worked as a research assistant for professor J. Christopher Beck at the
Department of Mechanical and Industrial Engineering. My stay there was funded
by a scholarship from the University of Toronto (UofT) and Toronto Intelligent
Decision Engineering Laboratory (TIDEL). During my research, I became extremely
interested in operations research, optimization and solving NP-hard
combinatorial problems with the help of distributed algorithms. Together with
another PhD student, we published a paper\cite{DuaGab2007} and the whole
experience abroad gave me new friends for life, deepened my analytical thinking
and broaden my knowledge in research and software development.
    \begin{itemize}
    \item Research in artificial intelligence and planning. Published paper:
          "Modelling Security Protocol Synthesis with AI Planning", UofT TIDEL,
          ON, Canada.
    \item Research in optimization, parallel and distributed algorithms and
          communications protocol. Published paper: "Solving Combinatorial
          Problems with Parallel Cooperative Solvers", Ninth International
          Workshop on Distributed Constraint Reasoning, Brown University
          Providence, Rhode Island, USA.
    \item MPI Cluster Computing, installation and configuration.
